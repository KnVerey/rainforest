== Rainforest: Project description

This Bitmaker Labs project is Kijiji-inspired: it allows users to list products they have to offer and message other users offering products they're interested in. It was the second Bitmaker Rails project, and we returned later in the program to it to implement some Ajax (in my case, for the messages users send).
